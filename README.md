### Game Maker

This repo contains a modest set of useful tools which can help to create games in VB.Net. It contains :
- A sounds manager,
- A buttons manager,
- A vector class with a lot of useful methods and functons,
- An animator class for animated sprites,
- Generic functions for collision detection, image manipulations and more.

All the documentation inside the code is in French.
